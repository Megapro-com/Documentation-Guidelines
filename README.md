Futures and Crypto markets are traded 24 hours a day.  
From Nov. 2021, some index options ( SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, ... ) will be traded 24 hours a day.  
Some brokers will start to offer US stock trading 24 hours a day.  
We focus on developing algorithms trading systems, so our robots will help us trade stocks, options, futures, and cryptos 24 hours a day.

We use robots to do a variety of things:  
* Collecting financial data;    
* Processing data via algorithms to generate new data;  
* Placing live trading orders via a broker's API:

* Sending trade alerts so we can review and placing manual orders;

Backtesting is an excellent way to tell if your trading system is sound or not.  
Do not waste your hard-earned money in live trading for untested trading systems.  
We provide some historical stock and ETF data for you to do backtesting free:

If you are team member, you can request more historical data for trading algorithm testing.

For active contributors to our Github site or various team projects, we will offer free Jupyter Notebook access to more up to date stocks, options, futures, and crypto data:
