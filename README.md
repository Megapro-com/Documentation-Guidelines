Futures and Crypto markets are traded 24 hours a day.  
From Nov. 2021, some index options ( SPX, NDX, RUT, VIX, ... ) will be traded 24 hours a day.  
Some brokers will start to offer US stock trading 24 hours a day.  
We focus on developing algorithms trading systems, so our robots will help us trade stocks, options, futures, and cryptos 24 hours a day.

We use robots to do a variety of things:  
* Collecting financial data;    
* Processing data via algorithms to generate new data;  
* Placing live trading orders via a broker's API:

* Sending trade alerts so we can review and placing manual orders;

Backtesting is an excellent way to tell if your trading system is sound or not.  
Do not waste your hard-earned money in live trading for untested trading systems.  
We provide some historical stock and ETF data for you to do backtesting free:
